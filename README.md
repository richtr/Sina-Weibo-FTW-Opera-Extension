Sina Weibo For The World - A social web experiment
==================================================

This extension adds a number of features to the popular [Sina Weibo Microblogging service](weibo.com) [(weibo.com)](weibo.com) to enable non-native Chinese speakers to interact with everyday Chinese people (and vice versa!). 

This extension for the Opera browser adds the following features for non-native Chinese users of Sina Weibo:

* A Google Translate bar that will translate all pages you visit at [weibo.com](weibo.com) in to your own native language. 
* A handy translate-as-you-type feature when you click in any text box available on the site 
allowing you to say something in your native language and have that posted on [weibo.com](weibo.com) in Chinese. 

This is a work in progress to connect disparate global voices. 

If we communicate then we will be friends - united by our similarities and not divided by our differences.
